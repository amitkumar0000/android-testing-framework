        See which campaigns or referrers launch your app after it is installed.

    Implementing Google Play Campaign Attribution
    ============================================
        When your app is downloaded from Google Play Store,
        the Play Store app broadcasts an INSTALL_REFERRER intent to your app during installation.
        This intent contains the value of the referrer parameter of the link used to reach your app's Google Play Store page,
        if one was present.

        To attribute an app download to a campaign, you must add a referrer parameter to any links that point to Google Play Store,
        and add a BroadcastReceiver to your app to receive and
        set the campaign information contained in the intent on your Google Analytics tracker.

        1. Add the Google Analytics receiver to your AndroidManifest.xml file.
           To add the Google Analytics receiver to the manifest, copy and paste the following markup:

           <application>
               <!-- Used for Google Play Store Campaign Measurement-->
               <receiver android:name="com.google.android.gms.analytics.CampaignTrackingReceiver"
                   android:enabled="true"
                   android:exported="true">
                   <intent-filter>
                       <action android:name="com.android.vending.INSTALL_REFERRER" />
                   </intent-filter>
               </receiver>
               <service android:name="com.google.android.gms.analytics.CampaignTrackingService"
                   android:enabled="true"
                   android:exported="false" />
           </application>
        2. Add Google Analytics Campaign Parameters to Google Play URLs
            Next, add a referrer parameter to any URLs that will be linking directly to Google Play Store
            and set the value of that parameter to a string of Google Analytics campaign parameters
            that describe the source, as in this example:

            https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.example.application
            &referrer=utm_source%3Dgoogle
            %26utm_medium%3Dcpc
            %26utm_term%3Drunning%252Bshoes
            %26utm_content%3Dlogolink
            %26utm_campaign%3Dspring_sale


        General Campaign & Traffic Source Attribution
        =============================================
        After an app has been installed, it may be launched by referrals from ad campaigns, websites, or other apps.
        In this scenario, referring traffic sources or marketing campaigns may be attributed to user activity
        in subsequent sessions by setting the campaign parameters
        on a tracker directly by using the setCampaignParamsFromUrl method.
